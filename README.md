### About the C programming language :

The C programming language :
- was created in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie
- is a low-level programming
- allows to manipulate data at processor level (without resorting to the assembler)
- does not manage memory (crumb collection)
- does not have a statement dealing with compound objects such as strings, structures, etc.
- does not provide input-output operations in the language (it uses libraries for these tasks)
- is a imperative procedural language (it uses statements that change a program's state & based on the concept of the procedure call)
- supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion with a static type system
- was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs
